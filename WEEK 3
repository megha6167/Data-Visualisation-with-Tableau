Week 3 problems(no problems were faced during weeks 1 and 2)
*These solutions are found out with the help of coursera discussion forums*

1. Stacking of Adjusted Paid Wage over Paid wage per year.
As default, when you move 'Measure Names' to size in Marks card you'll see a thin bar over the thick bar which is useless to look at.
So, to correct this you can use Analysis > Stack Marks > Off. This will remove the stacking of the two values.

2. Unable to perform Table Calculations
The table calculations are shown as invalid with a red pill.
Couldn't find why this was happening or how to correct it.
But found an alternative way to perform the same function by
-make a new calculated field 'Rank' with the code:"RANK([Adjusted Paid Wage],'desc')"
-drag this field to details
-make a table calculation for this field
-choose specific dimensions and tick both job title subgroup and work state
-set at the level to work state
-set restarting at to job title subgroup
-change the field to discrete and drag it to the columns 

3.Not able to locate the 'Number of Records' field.
You can find it under the name of Sheet(Count).
